Creating remote repositories
You can use the git remote add command to match a remote URL with a name. For example, you'd type the following in the command line:

git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
This associates the name origin with the REMOTE_URL.

You can use the command git remote set-url to change a remote's URL.
